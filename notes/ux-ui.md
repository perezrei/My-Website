design is something that can have a great impact in peoples life.

an idea grows when it can be shared

design is one of the most important factor when building a brand. If you donâ€™t put time, effort and even money into this, it may result in an unsuccessful business. The design is what will set you apart from your competition and help you garner the desired emotion or feeling from customers                         

             design thinking 

is a 5 steps process to propose ideas to solve problems to a specific group of people with new solutions:

   empathize. conduct interviews to know what the needs of the people are.

   define the problems. underline the verbs or the activities the people talk about in their problems. state a problem.

   ideate. solve the problems with the best ideas yo have and show them to the people you are trying to help and listen to their feedbacks.

   prototype. think about the new ideas you propose combined with the actual solution exists and design a prototype good enough to be tested.

   test. test the prototype with actual users and, listen to them and not try to defend your idea if the users don't like it. Just focus in the 
what was wrong or right and come back to ideation or prototyping until you have a prototype which solve the problem.

	frontend & backend development. once prototypes are approved, developers make the prototype a working product.
   reporting

	usability reporting. observe real users using the products

	split testing. testing the effectiveness of one design iteraction over another

Design thinking goes from comsumption to participation

design's too important to be left to designeers who should change from: converge (make choices) to: diverge (create choices)
